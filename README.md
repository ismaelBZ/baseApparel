- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Built with

### What I learned

The main knowledge obtained from this project is learning how Constraint Validation API works, performing form validation with it, styling error message and improving the positioning of elements on pages.


### Useful resources

MDN - [MDN - Form Validation docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
